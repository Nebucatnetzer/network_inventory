* network_inventory

I started this project in order to have solution for keeping an
inventory over my various servers and other network equipment.

** Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment inside of the repository for example
   with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 -m venv /path/to/repository
#+END_EXAMPLE

3. Cd into the repository and execute the setup.sh script. It will do
   some clean up tasks, install some python dependencies into the
   virtual environment, setup the database and a default user with the
   login ~admin~ and the password ~password~.
4. Afterwards you can run:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./manage.py runserver
#+END_EXAMPLE

   In order to run the developmenent server and access the application
   at http://localhost:8000
